      <p>
        Recently, Apple released a new operating system that is designed to give
        its users more control over data privacy. For all Apple devices on iOS
        14.5, apps are now required to ask the user if they will opt-in to app
        tracking. Devices on earlier iOS versions only require users to opt-out.

        If your Apple device is iOS 14.5 or later and you will or have
        interacted with an iOS App offer - those offers will require you to take
        additional steps. To offer you the best possible experience, we
        recommend that you opt-in to app tracking. Opting-in to App tracking
        will streamline your hard-earned reward without having to manually
        submit evidence of completion.

      <p>Check to see if your iOS operating system is 14.5 or later:</p>
      <p>
        On an <strong>iPhone, iPad,</strong> or <strong>iPod touch</strong>: To
        find the software version installed on your device, go to Settings &gt;
        General, then tap 'About'

        You are now required to complete an additional step,
        <em><strong>Opt-in to allow App Tracking (recommended)</strong></em> or
        <em><strong>submit evidence of completing the offer</strong></em

        By opting into App tracking with the app that is associated with the
        offer, it will streamline and simplify your experience.

      <p>
        Upon completing an offer, we can almost immediately release your
        rewards. This recommended approach is as simple as granting permissions
        to the app to track you across apps and websites.

        There is not a quick way to allow tracking for an app if you said “Ask
        App Not to Track” with the initial prompt.&nbsp; However, you can delete
        and redownload the app and you should get the tracking prompt again.

      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to opt-out of App Tracking, we now require that you submit
        evidence of your completion. Just as a heads up, this is a much slower
        process as it could take up to 7 days before you see your rewards.

        Our player support team will review your evidence and work with our

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Not all rewards are instantaneous - While some offer rewards will
            appear in your account right away, other offers require additional
            time before they appear. This depends on the offer type - your
            reward could be delayed up to 48 hours before it is reflected in
            your account.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You will not receive your reward when our advertising partners
            cannot recognize your offer completion in the following scenarios:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                App tracking is disabled after you click on the ad offer AND
                before you have completed the offer instructions
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                App tracking is disabled DURING the process of completing the
                offer. If this occurs, you are required to submit a support
                ticket with evidence of offer completion
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            If you are still missing your rewards - please submit your
            completion and our team with review your submission.

        My completion submission was denied, why and what do I do now?
      </h4>
      <p>
        There could be a number of reasons why your submission was denied, here
        are a few common reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The offer was not completed</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Submitted fake proof</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use of VPNs to access offers that you are not eligible for, due to
            geographic or other restrictions
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Being abusive to our player support team or otherwise violating our
            User Terms of Service
