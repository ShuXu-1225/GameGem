      <p><strong>What is a device ID?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A Device ID is a string of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies
        individual mobile (smartphone or tablet) devices.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          iOS device identifier is called IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers)
        </li>
        <li>
          Android device identifier is called AdID (Advertising Identifier)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How to locate your IDFA (iOS Advertising ID)</strong></p>
      <p>
        The advertising ID on iOS devices is hidden from users by Apple by
        default but it can be retrieved with third-party apps. Here are a few
        selected apps for iOS that can show a device’s IDFA to users:
      </p>
