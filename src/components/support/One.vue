      <h2 id="ios-145">iOS 14.5</h2>
      <p>
        Recently, Apple released a new operating system that is designed to give
        its users more control over data privacy. For all Apple devices on iOS
        14.5, apps are now required to ask the user if they will opt-in to app
        app tracking. Devices on earlier iOS versions only require users to
        opt-out.
