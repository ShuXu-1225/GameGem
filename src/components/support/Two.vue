      <p>
        These GameGem User Terms Of Service govern User access to and use of the
        services we offer, including our presentation of advertising offers and
        our customer support (collectively, “Services”). Together with our
        Privacy Policy, which describes our data collection and use practices,
        these User Terms Of Service form the agreement between you and GameGem
        relating to your access to and use of our Services (“Agreement”),
        effective as of the date you accept the User Terms Of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        THESE GAMEGEM USER TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION
        AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. By accepting
        these User Terms Of Service, you agree to arbitration under the
        arbitration terms below, and waive your right to pursue a class action
        or to have your dispute decided by a jury. See “Dispute Resolution,
        Agreement to Arbitrate, Class Action Waiver, and Jury Trial Waiver”

        By using GameGem services, you are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement.

        you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity and accept

        not accept the Agreement, then GameGem does not authorize you or the
        entity to access or use our Services. (References to “you” mean the

      <h2 id="player-support">Player Support</h2>
      <p>
        GameGem offers customer support to users for issues related to advertising
        offers. However, not all publishers using GameGem products (e.g. the
        offerwall) opt in to GameGem player support. In these cases, we cannot
        help Players with missing rewards and users will need to handle directly
        with the Publisher.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>To make a support request,</strong>
        <span @click="clickHandler(1)"
          ><em><strong>follow these steps</strong></em></span
        >. We cannot accept requests submitted through any other channel and
        will not respond.**

      <h4 id="initial-request-timing-requirements">
        <strong>Initial Request – Timing Requirements</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Because rewards for completed advertising offers may take up to 24 hours
        to appear in your account, you are required to wait 24 hours after
        starting an offer to submit a Support Request. If the issue persists
        after 24 hours, you can submit a request using the steps linked above.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be eligible for rewards, offers must be completed within 30 days of
        your first interaction with the advertising offer involved in your
        request. If an offer is completed after that 30-day window, no rewards
        can be given.

        <strong>Response and Resolution</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        GameGem strives to resolve requests quickly, however some support requests
        require multiple rounds of investigation and may necessitate contacting
        the User, Advertiser and/or Publisher. GameGem makes no guarantee that
        support requests will be resolved within a specific time frame. In order
        to be eligible for rewards, you agree to cooperate with GameGem and
        provide any requested information. Failure to assist GameGem in a timely
        manner as requested, for example by providing legitimate screenshots or
        other information, may result in your support request being closed,
        without notice. GameGem reserves the right to close any request, at any
        time, with no written warning, communication or explanation provided to
        the User.
      </p>
      <h4 id="behavior-expectations"><strong>Behavior Expectations</strong></h4>
      <p>
        A great User experience is the goal of GameGem Player Support. However,
        abusive language or actions; use of profanity or other abusive behavior
        may result in immediate closure of your support request and the
        suspension or permanent termination of your GameGem privileges, without
        notice. GameGem reserves the right to ban Users from using the Services at
        our sole discretion.

      <h2 id="offer-eligibility">Offer Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        To be rewarded for completing an Advertiser offer, you must be eligible.
        To be eligible for an offer and potential associated rewards, you must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be new user to the app, survey or service that you are being rewarded
          for interacting with. This means never having had an account under any
          name, email or user ID on any device. Uninstalling and re-downloading
          apps, or quitting services or subscriptions in order to sign up again
          do not make a user eligible for rewards again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never have completed or submitted a Player Support Request for an
          advertising offer from the same app, survey or service. (i.e. If you
          completed a level 10 offer, you cannot be eligible for a level 12
          offer, or an offer requiring any other action in the same app)
        </li>
        <li>
          Be in the correct geographic location and not using a VPN or similar
          technology to access offers outside your physical geographic area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be able to provide comprehensive, honest and indisputable evidence of
          offer completion upon GameGem’s request. (i.e. a screenshot on your
          device clearly showing offer completion)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following actions and behaviors may result in users being blocked
        from using GameGem services and/or closing of player support requests
        without notice, GameGem’s sole discretion.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Abusive or rude behavior towards GameGem Support Team.</li>
        <li>
          Player support requests submitted more than 30 days after the initial
          interaction with the advertising offer for which you are seeking help.
        </li>
        <li>Failure to respond to GameGem communication and/or requests.</li>
        <li>Failure to provide evidence of offer completion as requested.</li>
        <li>
          Use of fake screenshots or evidence, including: doctored or edited
          images, images found on the internet, any image not taken from your
          own device.
        </li>
        <li>Attempting to be rewarded for the same offer(s) multiple times.</li>
        <li>
          Attempting to appear as multiple users for the purpose of being
          rewarded more than once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using any method to mask, change or hide your geographical location
          for the purpose of accessing offers unavailable in your actual,
          physical location.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using device emulators or any similar methods or tools to access the
          offerwall and/or attempt to complete offers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All decisions and judgments regarding eligibility are made in AdAction’s
        sole discretion and are final.
      </p>
      <h4 id="offer-value">Offer Value</h4>
      <p>
        GameGem is not responsible for the value or amount of any reward promised,
        released or withheld by any GameGem Publisher. GameGem has no ability to
        control the specific amount of points, coins, currency or any reward
        denomination for a completed offer. To rectify this issue, Users must
        contact the Publisher directly. GameGem is not responsible for any
        monetary value associated with any offer shown to users in any GameGem
        product.
      </p>
      <h4 id="user-data">User Data</h4>
      <p>
        When you submit a player support request, GameGem may receive and store
        identifiers involved in your request — specifically, the advertising
        identifier (IDFA for iOS devices, Android Advertising ID for Android
        devices), along with your email address and IP address. We use this
        information to verify offer eligibility with advertisers, respond to
        your request and help prevent fraud. If resolution of your request
        requires coordination with the advertiser or publisher involved, we may
        share your support request information with them, including the device
        identifiers and your email address, as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        We combine and analyze information about customer support requests,
        including device identifiers and IP addresses, to identify trends, spot
        problems, prevent fraud, and look for ways to improve our services.

        These User Terms Of Service, and any dispute arising between GAMEGEM and
        you under the Terms or otherwise in connection with your use of the
        Services, shall be governed by applicable federal law, the Federal

      <h3 id="eu-residents">EU Residents</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a resident of a European Union Member State and you wish to
        institute an action arising from or relating to the subject matter of
        this Agreement, you may do so through binding arbitration as set forth
        below, or through the national courts of your country.
      </p>
      <h3 id="non-eu-residents">Non-EU Residents</h3>
      <p>
        For users residing outside the European Union, you and we agree that any
        dispute arising from or relating to the Services or this Agreement shall
        be finally settled by arbitration, using the English language and
        conducted by one arbitrator in the State of Colorado.
      </p>
      <h3 id="arbitration">Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        In arbitration, instead of a judge or jury, there is an arbitrator, and
        court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator
        can grant, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a
        court, including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered in a court having
        jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial
        acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.
        The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
        of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
      </p>
      <h3 id="class-action-waiver">Class Action Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        Both parties agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
        conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated
        or representative action. The decision of the arbitrator (or small
        claims court judge) only affects the specific parties involved in the
        claim, and will never extend to third parties or other users of our
        Services.

        Both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United
        States Federal Courts located in the State of Colorado for any dispute
        not handled through arbitration or in small claims court, as described
        above. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in

        between the parties, that shall not affect the enforceability of the
        rest of the User Terms Of Service.

      <h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h4 id="q-i-completed-an-offer-but-did-not-get-my-reward-why">
        Q: I completed an offer but did not get my reward. Why?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: There are a number of reasons why you may not have received a reward
        upon completing an offer. Here are the most common reasons we see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All offers that require an app download, the user must be a first
          time, new user to that app. If that app has been downloaded on that
          device at any time in the past, the user is NOT eligible for that
          offer and will not be rewarded for any completed offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          All offers that require a free trial, subscription or account, the
          user must be a first time, new user to that service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer requires user to COMPLETE a certain level, but the user only
          REACHED that level. For example, many users start a “Complete Level 8”
          offer and then only REACH level 8, instead of completing it. In that
          example, you would need to reach level 9 (indicating that you’ve
          completed level 8) to receive the reward.
        </li>
        <li>
          User has been rewarded for an offer for the same app in the past. We
          have records of which users have been rewarded for which offers. If a
          user is rewarded for an offer for App X, then that user cannot be a
          new user to App X, and therefore would be ineligible for all App X
          offers in the future. If we see that you have been rewarded for an
          app’s offer before, we will close all requests for rewards for that
          app in the future, without reward.
        </li>
        <li>
          User didn’t click a “finish” or “submit” button, or complete final
          action. Especially with survey offers, there is often a requirement to
          “Share the survey” that is the final step to complete the offer. Make
          sure to read the offer requirements in detail and ensure you’ve
          followed them exactly.
        </li>

        Q: My Player Support Request was not rewarded, but I sent screenshots.
        Please explain.
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: First, make sure you were eligible. See the question directly above
        this to make sure you were eligible for the offer. If you were not, we
        may have closed your case based on ineligibility. Next, we review
        evidence sent by Users and try to determine what is legitimate to the
        best of our ability. We receive tons of fraudulent requests and
        screenshots that users found on the internet. It’s very common for users
        to find fake screenshots and not attempt to actually complete the offer.
        There are several characteristics we look for that typically mean the
        evidence is not legitimate. To be rewarded, you must send clear
        screenshots taken on your device that show indisputable evidence that
        you completed every requirement of the offer.

        id="q-i-had-this-app-a-long-time-ago-but-had-deleted-it-if-i-download-it-to-complete-this-offer-will-i-get-my-reward"
      >
        Q: I had this app a long time ago, but had deleted it. If I download it
        to complete this offer, will I get my reward?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: No, you have to be a first time, new user to any app you download as
        part of an GAMEGEM offerwall offer. If you’ve ever had the app in the
        past, you are not eligible.
      </p>
      <h4 id="q-how-long-do-i-have-to-wait-for-my-reward">
        Q: How long do I have to wait for my reward?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: It can take up to and sometimes a bit more than 24 hours for GameGem to
        receive the signal that the offer has been completed. We can’t trigger
        release of any currency or rewards until that happens.
      </p>
      <h4
        id="q-i-responded-to-your-email-but-got-a-response-about-a-subject-line-being-incorrect-what-do-i-do"
      >
        Q: I responded to your email but got a response about a subject line
        being incorrect. What do I do?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: When you respond to our email regarding your Player Support Case, DO
        NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. This subject line is how our
        system matches your email and evidence of offer completion to the Player
        Support Request submitted.
      </p>
      <h4
        id="q-can-i-complete-multiple-offers-for-the-same-app-eg-get-rewarded-for-installing-and-opening-the-app-then-do-another-offer-for-level-3"
      >
        Q: Can I complete multiple offers for the same app? (e.g. Get rewarded
        for installing and opening the app, then do another offer for level 3?)
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: No. Once you start an offer for a specific app, you cannot be
        eligible for another offer from that app because you are now not a new
        user to that app. If we see that you have opened multiple player support
        requests for the same app, you may be rewarded for the first one you
        clicked on, but all others will be closed without reward.

      <h4 id="q-can-i-use-a-vpn-to-access-offers-on-the-adgem-offerwall">
        Q: Can I use a VPN to access offers on the GameGem offerwall?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: No. Using a VPN is strictly prohibited. Our offers are targeted to
        certain locations and users are not allowed to access the offerwall
        using any tool or service that obfuscates or falsifies the geo-location
        of their device.

        Q: Can I use a emulator to complete offers on the GameGem offerwall?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A: No. Using device emulators or any similar methods or tools to access
        the offerwall and/or attempt to complete offers is strictly prohibited.
