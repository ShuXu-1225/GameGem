Why?\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: There are a number of reasons why you may not have received a reward\n        upon completing an offer. Here are the most common reasons we see:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          All offers that require an app download, the user must be a first\n          time, new user to that app. If that app has been downloaded on that\n          device at any time in the past, the user is NOT eligible for that\n          offer and will not be rewarded for any completed offer.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          All offers that require a free trial, subscription or account, the\n          user must be a first time, new user to that service.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Offer requires user to COMPLETE a certain level, but the user only\n          REACHED that level. For example, many users start a “Complete Level 8”\n          offer and then only REACH level 8, instead of completing it. In that\n          example, you would need to reach level 9 (indicating that you’ve\n          completed level 8) to receive the reward.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          User has been rewarded for an offer for the same app in the past. We\n          have records of which users have been rewarded for which offers. If a\n          user is rewarded for an offer for App X, then that user cannot be a\n          new user to App X, and therefore would be ineligible for all App X\n          offers in the future. If we see that you have been rewarded for an\n          app’s offer before, we will close all requests for rewards for that\n          app in the future, without reward.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          User didn’t click a “finish” or “submit” button, or complete final\n          action. Especially with survey offers, there is often a requirement to\n          “Share the survey” that is the final step to complete the offer. Make\n          sure to read the offer requirements in detail and ensure you’ve\n          followed them exactly.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4\n        id=\"q-my-player-support-request-was-not-rewarded-but-i-sent-screenshots-please-explain\"\n      >\n        Q: My Player Support Request was not rewarded, but I sent screenshots.\n        Please explain.\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: First, make sure you were eligible. See the question directly above\n        this to make sure you were eligible for the offer. If you were not, we\n        may have closed your case based on ineligibility. Next, we review\n        evidence sent by Users and try to determine what is legitimate to the\n        best of our ability. We receive tons of fraudulent requests and\n        screenshots that users found on the internet. It’s very common for users\n        to find fake screenshots and not attempt to actually complete the offer.\n        There are several characteristics we look for that typically mean the\n        evidence is not legitimate. To be rewarded, you must send clear\n        screenshots taken on your device that show indisputable evidence that\n        you completed every requirement of the offer.\n      </p>\n      <h4\n        id=\"q-i-had-this-app-a-long-time-ago-but-had-deleted-it-if-i-download-it-to-complete-this-offer-will-i-get-my-reward\"\n      >\n        Q: I had this app a long time ago, but had deleted it. If I download it\n        to complete this offer, will I get my reward?\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: No, you have to be a first time, new user to any app you download as\n        part of an GAMEGEM offerwall offer. If you’ve ever had the app in the\n        past, you are not eligible.\n      </p>\n      <h4 id=\"q-how-long-do-i-have-to-wait-for-my-reward\">\n        Q: How long do I have to wait for my reward?\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: It can take up to and sometimes a bit more than 24 hours for GameGem to\n        receive the signal that the offer has been completed. We can’t trigger\n        release of any currency or rewards until that happens.\n      </p>\n      <h4\n        id=\"q-i-responded-to-your-email-but-got-a-response-about-a-subject-line-being-incorrect-what-do-i-do\"\n      >\n        Q: I responded to your email but got a response about a subject line\n        being incorrect. What do I do?\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: When you respond to our email regarding your Player Support Case, DO\n        NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. This subject line is how our\n        system matches your email and evidence of offer completion to the Player\n        Support Request submitted.\n      </p>\n      <h4\n        id=\"q-can-i-complete-multiple-offers-for-the-same-app-eg-get-rewarded-for-installing-and-opening-the-app-then-do-another-offer-for-level-3\"\n      >\n        Q: Can I complete multiple offers for the same app? (e.g. Get rewarded\n        for installing and opening the app, then do another offer for level 3?)\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: No. Once you start an offer for a specific app, you cannot be\n        eligible for another offer from that app because you are now not a new\n        user to that app. If we see that you have opened multiple player support\n        requests for the same app, you may be rewarded for the first one you\n        clicked on, but all others will be closed without reward.\n      </p>\n      <h4 id=\"q-can-i-use-a-vpn-to-access-offers-on-the-adgem-offerwall\">\n        Q: Can I use a VPN to access offers on the GameGem offerwall?\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        A: No. Using a VPN is strictly prohibited.
